# Command Line Applications - Benchmarking Project

For the project contained within this repository, we put ourselves in the position of a data scientist working for a company that is interested in whether it should conduct its data science operations using Go, Python, or R. To help leadership make this decision, the company's leadership asks the data scientist to conduct an experiment focused on assessing the computational efficiency and statistical accuracy of each of these three languages via benchmark testing. Specifically, the data scientist must create programs that will run from the Windows Command Prompt Application, import a CSV file containing a 7-variable dataset, compute summary statistics for each of the variables, and print the summary statistics to an output text file. The data scientist must confirm that R, Python, and Go all correctly calculate the correct values for the summary statistics and must compare how quickly each of these three languages completes those calculations.

The Batch file within this repository can be called by the Windows Command Prompt Application to call the Python, R, and Go code (also contained within this repository) to execute the benchmark testing experiment described above.  We see that Go, Python, and R were able to successfully calculate the correct values for the summary statistics (including minimum, maximum and mean) for each of the seven variables in the CSV input dataset.  Each of the three programming languages also conducted 100 iterations of these calculations, so that we could gain a representative sample of benchmark test trial times for each programming language.  The three programs printed their summary statistics calculations, as well as their eperimental runtimes to the output text files contained within this repository.

By examining the results, we see that the average benchmarking experiment trial runtimes for Go, Python, and R were 23,146 microseconds , 27,832 microseconds, and 100,810 microseconds, respectively.

If I were to make a recommendation to management based on the findings of this study, I would encourage leadership to consider its organizational objectives when deciding whether to leverage Python, R, or Go for future data science projects.  That's because each of these three languages comes with its own distinct advantages and disadvantages.  For example, if management were purely focused on the efficiency of a program when running code to calculate summary statistics from the Command Prompt Application, then I would recommend leveraging R, since it performed the strongest in the benchmark experiment described above.  However, leadership may still want to consider other benefits of leveraging each language.  For example, Go enforces coding best practices that cause programmers to write code in an idiomatic and readable fashion.  Also, Python creates data visualizations that are the most appealing of these three languages.  Meanwhile, R is perhaps the most commonly used language for data science, so there exist many online resources to help programmers write and debug R code, and the firm might have relatively little difficulty recruiting talented R programmers to the company.  In these ways, each of the three languages examined in this study have their own strengths and weaknesses.  Still, if the company is purely focused on the results of this Command Line Application benchmarking study that examined the ability of each language to import CSV files, calculate summary statistics, and generate output text files, then the company should elect to use R for its data science operations, since R was the most computationally efficient language.
